## Newsletter

Along with the previous post, I’ve created an email newsletter. I’ll use it to
notify about new posts on the blog, so you don’t need to keep checking manually.
Just drop your email in and you’ll know when something new is up.

Setting it up wasn’t as straightforward as I expected. I had to fight with DNS
records quite a bit 😅. It was a fun rabbit hole though, and I’ll definitely write
a separate post about the details and gotchas. Hopefully, it’ll save someone else
the same headache.

For now, if you want to follow along with my writing, the newsletter is the easiest
way to stay updated.

## About

I’ve also created a new “About” page. You can find it in the header. Right now
it’s a short version of who I am and what I do, but I’m planning to refine it
with more details, stories, and maybe even some fun facts.

It felt important to have a proper space where new readers can quickly get a sense
of the person behind the posts. Blogging feels a bit more personal this way.

## Projects

Additionally, there’s now a “Projects” page that lists all of the side projects
I’ve built (or am currently tinkering with). You can check it out in the header
as well.

I always enjoy reading about what other people are building, so I thought it would
be nice to share my own experiments in one place. Some of them are small, some
are ongoing, and some are just for fun. But together they give a better picture
of what I like working on outside of my day job.

## Refactoring

Furthermore, I've refactored a couple of the components that I've built for various
visualizations, and separated the common components. Now, all visualizations should
feel more consistent, but there's definitely a space for improvements as well.

I'm thinking about replacing some of the common components with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/),
because, quite frankly, I'm not so great at design, and these components look a
lot more consistent. Honestly, I can go on quite a rant about different approaches
there, and maybe sometime I will 😀

## What’s next

This is just the beginning. I want the website to grow along with my writing and
projects. Expect more posts, more tinkering, and definitely more lessons learned
along the way.

If you spot anything odd or have feedback, I’d love to hear from you. And of course
don’t forget to subscribe to the newsletter 😉
