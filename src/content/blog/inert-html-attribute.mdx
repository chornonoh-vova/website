There are always elements on the page that I've developed that serve no purpose;
they are purely decorative. There are multiple things that we need to account
for when adding such elements to the page. Let‚Äôs go through the techniques and
what problems they are solving.

## pointer-events

The first thing that we want to achieve is to prevent an element from being clickable
and focusable. We can do it with a simple CSS rule:

```css
.example {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

‚¨ÜÔ∏è Prevent the element from being clickable/focusable.

There are additional capabilities of the pointer-events property; for example,
you can have an SVG element receive pointer events only on the stroke or only on
the fill.

Read more in the [pointer-events documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events).

## user-select

If we‚Äôre displaying some purely decorative emojis, they should also not be selectable
by the user. There is a CSS rule that exists to do that as well:

```css
.example {
  user-select: none;
}
```

‚¨ÜÔ∏è Prevent the text from being selectable.

The other interesting thing about this property is that you can set it to `all`,
and users will only be able to select the element fully, not letter by letter.

Read more in the [user-select documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select).

Surprisingly, this CSS property is not in the baseline, because it‚Äôs not supported
in the WebView on iOS ü´†

## aria-hidden

We also want to hide the element from the screen readers. It can be achieved with
an HTML attribute aria-hidden.

For example:

```html
<div aria-hidden="true">
  <!-- Some elements content -->
</div>
```

‚¨ÜÔ∏è Hides the element from the screen readers.

Recently, I caused an accessibility issue with this one ü´£. It's because one of
the icons had an off-screen text associated with it, and a visible label right next
to it, essentially reading the icon description twice.

It's a pretty common technique to hide an element description from view, but leave
it in the accessibility tree so that screen readers can still present it to users
who need it. TailwindCSS has the [sr-only](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/display#screen-reader-only)
utility class for it.

Read more in the [aria-hidden documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-hidden).

## inert

What if we could achieve all of the above‚Ä¶ With one attribute?

Turns out, we can do that with an inert HTML attribute. This attribute disables
click and focus events, disallows selection, and hides an element from screen
readers. Furthermore, this attribute has excellent browser support!

```html
<div inert>
  <!-- Some elements content -->
</div>
```

Additionally, all of the child elements will inherit inert from the parent, except
for `<dialog>`, that kind of "escapes" this inertness. It can be made inert only
by placing an inert attribute on itself.

Read more in the [inert documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/inert)

Here's a small demo with the `inert` attribute usage:

<RandomEmojiSpawner client:load />

Just press a button, and random emojis will get added onto the page! But you
won't be able to click or select them, and they won't show up in the accessibility
tree.

There's also a checkbox that allows you to disable `inert`, and you'll be able to
see how awful user experience becomes without it üôÉ

Btw, sometimes if you click too fast, Safari makes a page zoom-in (because there's
a double-tap gesture to do that). I've disabled it for this demo container.

Read more in the [touch-action documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action)
and additionally, [touch-action utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/touch-action)
in TailwindCSS.

## Conclusion

Sometimes, basic features of HTML are forgotten, but it is essential for a frontend
engineer to know them. And of course, nobody can know everything, but just visit MDN
from time to time, and I guarantee you, you'll find something useful in there üòâ
