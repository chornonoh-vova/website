Welcome to Advent of Code 2025 🎉

On this page I will be documenting my struggles, solutions and, sometimes visualizations
for days of this challenge. Let's begin!

## Day 1

The task is pretty straightforward (as I find it later), but I started over-complicating
the solution, and it backfired quickly.

I've solved the first part mathematically:

```ts
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";
import process from "node:process";

const filename = process.argv[2];

const instructions = (await readFile(filename, "utf-8")).trim().split("\n");

class Safe {
  #dial: number;
  cnt: number;

  constructor(initial: number) {
    this.#dial = initial;
    this.cnt = 0;
  }

  turnLeft(amount: number) {
    this.#dial = (((this.#dial - amount) % 100) + 100) % 100;
    this.#checkCounter();
  }

  turnRight(amount: number) {
    this.#dial = (this.#dial + amount) % 100;
    this.#checkCounter();
  }

  #checkCounter() {
    if (this.#dial === 0) {
      this.cnt++;
    }
  }
}

const safe = new Safe(50);

for (const instruction of instructions) {
  const dir = instruction.substring(0, 1);
  const amount = parseInt(instruction.substring(1));

  if (dir === "L") {
    safe.turnLeft(amount);
  } else {
    safe.turnRight(amount);
  }
}

console.log("part 1:", safe.cnt);
```

But for the second part... Well, I couldn't figure out how to calculate everything
essentially in one operation. So I switched back to simulating the whole process,
and in doing so, I've simplified and refactored it a lot:

```ts
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";
import { argv, exit } from "node:process";

const filename = argv[2];

if (!filename) {
  console.error("expect filename");
  exit(1);
}

const instructions = (await readFile(filename, "utf-8")).trim().split("\n");

type Direction = "L" | "R";

class Safe {
  #dial: number;
  part1: number;
  part2: number;

  constructor(initial = 50) {
    this.#dial = initial;
    this.part1 = 0;
    this.part2 = 0;
  }

  turn(direction: Direction, amount: number) {
    const dir = direction === "L" ? -1 : 1;

    for (let i = 0; i < amount; ++i) {
      this.#dial += dir;
      this.#dial %= 100;

      if (!this.#dial) {
        this.part2++;
      }
    }

    if (!this.#dial) {
      this.part1++;
    }
  }
}

const safe = new Safe();

for (const instruction of instructions) {
  const direction = instruction.substring(0, 1) as Direction;
  const amount = parseInt(instruction.substring(1));

  safe.turn(direction, amount);
}

console.log("part 1:", safe.part1);
console.log("part 2:", safe.part2);
```

And this was quite a good starting point for visualization, that I set out to
implement, after seeing some inspiring visuals on Reddit.
