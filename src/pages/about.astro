      Hi, I’m Volodymyr Chornonoh — a senior full-stack software engineer who
      enjoys building things that are both practical and elegant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past several years, I’ve worked with React + TypeScript on the
      frontend and Java + Spring Boot on the backend, designing and scaling
      applications powered by MySQL, SQL Server, and RabbitMQ. I’m passionate
      about clean architecture, thoughtful system design, and writing code that
      others actually enjoy maintaining.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, I’m also writing on this blog, where I share lessons learned
      from real-world engineering: from database migrations and tricky bug hunts
      to algorithms, side projects, and experiments like solving Advent of Code.
      If you’re curious about practical software engineering, problem-solving,
      and learning by building, you’ll feel right at home here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work, you’ll probably find me gaming, tinkering with puzzle
      game ideas, or diving into a good book.
